# beingagile

Hello world ! 

I've been chatting to getify who said he's used GitHub for his book .. It sounded very agile and while not code I hope I can use got hub to share some of my thinking in the world of agile project management and get some feedback .. I did a bit of coding at uni but it's not my strength but I am hoping to master mark down and also use the experience on here to support my work with Software Cornwall which aims to get more into software engineering in Cornwall (www.softwarecornwall.org) 

My mission is to explain being agile to those new to the method in software and to customers and businesses looking for a better way to work - my book aims to explain agile to businesses investing in software in a context they get - their own businesses 

Thanks

Belinda
